# Analysis_scripts_for_Accelerated-signal-propagation-speed-in-human-neocortical-dendrites

In this repository you can find the analysis scripts for the article entilted: Accelerated signal propagation speed in human neocortical-dendrites
The electrophysiologiacal recordings were exported from HEKA patchmaster into ASCII format and all the scripts run on ASCII files except the statisctical analyis and the plotting parts which has .xlsx inputs generated by the main scripts.
